# KSP-Autopilot-Script-and-Spaceplane
This is the script that takes my space plane to orbit, plus the ship file and the mods needed to make it work. (This works for KSP 1.2.2.1622)
Once the mods are installed, place the script inside the "Kerbal Space Program\Ships\Script" directory. You can use the method I use in the video to run the program:
"switch to 0."
"runpath("launchspaceplane")."
