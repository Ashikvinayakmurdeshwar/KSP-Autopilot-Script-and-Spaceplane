# KSP-Autopilot-Script-and-Spaceplane
This is the script that takes my space plane to orbit. There are a few mods that are needed to make it work. (This works for KSP 1.2.2.1622)
CommunityResourcePack, InterstellarFuelSwitch, Kerbaltek, kOS, TweakScale. (Some mods may not be needed, but I included them anyway because I wasn't sure.)
Once the mods are installed, put the ship file into the SPH folder and place the script inside the "Kerbal Space Program\Ships\Script" directory. You can use the method I use in the video to run the program:
"switch to 0."
"runpath("launchspaceplane")."
